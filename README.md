# A/B Testing Analytics

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end A/B testing analysis for a product experiment.

## Objective
Evaluate whether a new product feature improves user conversion compared to the existing experience.

## Experiment Design
- Users are randomly assigned to Control (A) or Treatment (B)
- Each user belongs to only one group
- The experiment measures behavioral differences between the two groups

## Primary Metric
**Conversion Rate**

Conversion Rate = Converted Users / Total Users

## Hypothesis
- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no difference in conversion rate between control and treatment.
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** The treatment group has a higher conversion rate than the control group.
